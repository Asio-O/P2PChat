# Agent Notes

English | [中文](README.zh.md)

One kind of design doc lives here. An **Agent Note** records a decision or proposal that affects this codebase — the *why* and *what we gave up*, the parts code and docs can't carry. This file defines where Agent Notes live, when to write one, and [the in-file format](#the-file-format).

## Layout and naming

Every Agent Note has two axes, both encoded in its **path** — `{lifecycle}/{class}/yyyy-mm-dd-topic-title.md`:

- **Lifecycle** (the top-level folder) is the Agent Note's status, and an Agent Note moves between folders as that status changes:
  - **`proposed/`** — proposals reviewed before implementation; not yet built (or only partly).
  - **`implemented/`** — the decision shipped. The file records what was decided and what was rejected, and is **kept current with what actually shipped**: when the code later moves a file, renames a package, or changes a key/default, the Agent Note is updated in the same change to match (facts only — paths, names, structure — not the decision itself).
  - **`rejected/`** — the proposal was considered and declined. Keep it only while its rationale prevents a tempting, meaningful mistake; otherwise delete the complete triplet.
- **Class** (the nested folder) is the *kind* of decision — see [Classification](#classification) below.

The date in the filename is when the topic was **first proposed** (per git history). Cross-references between Agent Notes use relative markdown links (`[topic](../../implemented/architecture/2026-…-….md)`) — never bare prose or numbers — so they are mechanically checkable and survive moves between folders.

The active lifecycle tree is the working inventory: browse its lifecycle/class folders or search the repository. Do not add a centralized `INDEX.md`. Low-future-value implemented records move to the separate frozen Agent Note archive described below.

## Classification

Each Agent Note belongs to one path-encoded class from a closed set; placement in any other folder is rejected by review. Adding a class requires updating this section. The closed set:

| Class | What it covers |
|---|---|
| `feature` | A new user- or model-facing capability. |
| `bug-fix` | Corrects a defect or closes a gap a postmortem surfaced. |
| `simplification` | Removes code, behavior, or surface area without adding a capability. |
| `architecture` | A structural decision about the **shipped source** — how packages relate, what the runtime vocabulary is. |
| `process` | Tooling, policy, or workflow **around** the code — gates, the package manager, vendoring — not runtime behavior. |
| `testing` | Test infrastructure and strategy. |

The `architecture` / `process` line: **architecture** is about the source we ship; **process** is the surrounding tooling and workflow. (`refactor` is deliberately absent — it overlaps `simplification`, whose discriminator, "does observable behavior change?", already covers it.)

## Archiving and deletion

Archive an implemented Agent Note when the shipped decision is complete and its rationale is unlikely to guide future work. Keep it active when its alternatives, ownership boundary, negative guarantee, durable or wire semantics, security rule, or reintroduction condition remains useful. Never archive a proposed note: reject an obsolete proposal. Keep a rejected note only while it prevents a plausible mistake; otherwise delete its English, Chinese, and sidecar files together. Apply these rules by judgment in PR review, not as a literal, age, or quota metric.

The Agent Note archive is path-encoded as `archived/{class}/yyyy-mm-dd-topic-title.md`; `implemented` is deliberately absent because only implemented notes can enter it. An archival change moves the complete English/Chinese/sidecar triplet, retains `Status: implemented`, inserts the same `Archived: YYYY-MM-DD` line immediately below that status in both language files, re-records the sidecar, and repairs or deletes inbound links. These are the only permitted content changes during archival.

Once sealed, every archived triplet is permanently frozen. Do not edit, translate, reformat, update, move, or delete it, and do not treat it as authority for current behavior. Documentation tooling skips archived sources, including their outbound links; active prose may still link into an archived note when it intentionally cites history.

## When to write one

Every non-trivial change MUST add or update at least one Agent Note in the same PR. A change is non-trivial when it alters behavior, architecture, a contract shared across files or packages, process or tooling, testing strategy, an on-disk, wire, or configuration format, or another decision a maintainer may reasonably revisit. A proposal for substantial future work starts in `proposed/`; a decision already made starts in `implemented/`. Pick the class folder that matches the decision (see [Classification](#classification)).

Updating the Agent Note that already owns the decision satisfies the rule; do not create a duplicate. Only a purely mechanical or local edit with no change to behavior, contracts, structure, process, or rationale is exempt. An Agent Note is never edited into a *different decision*: supersede it with a new one, and keep both notes cross-linked unless the old note is later fully consolidated under the rule below. Editing an `implemented/` Agent Note to track where its existing decision lives is required, not forbidden.

An implemented Agent Note that is fully superseded may be consolidated into the current owning note and deleted. Before deletion, the owner must preserve every unique rationale, alternative, consequence, required verification, and named coverage gap; repair every inbound link; and delete the Chinese counterpart and consistency record in the same change. Partial supersession does not qualify: keep both notes cross-linked and update every fact that remains current. Consolidation must not rewrite the old file into its opposite or rely on git history as the only copy of rationale.

A feature-addition note may be consolidated into the later removal note only when the feature is absent from production code, configuration, schemas, durable or wire formats, migration, and compatibility behavior; no current documentation presents it as available; and no test exercises it as supported behavior. Removal rationale and tests that verify absence may remain. The removal owner preserves the original motivation, why it no longer justified the feature, alternatives to full removal, the capability given up, conditions for reintroduction, and verification of complete absence. Obsolete implementation inventories and tests that only verified the deleted behavior are not current verification evidence. Removing one transport, default, implementation, or presentation is partial supersession, as is any surviving durable data or compatibility handling.

## The file format

Every active Agent Note follows one in-file format. Reviewers verify the format manually against this README. Archived notes retain the format they had when sealed plus the archive-date line above.

### The header block

The first three lines of every Agent Note are exactly:

```markdown
# Agent Note: <title>

Status: <status>
```

followed by a blank line. The `Status:` value is one of three forms, and must agree with the lifecycle folder the file sits in — the gate cross-checks them:

- `Status: proposed`
- `Status: implemented`
- `Status: rejected — <why, in one line>`

The status carries no dates and no parentheticals: the filename holds the first-proposed date, git holds everything else, and an "accepted in amended form" note is body content (state the amendment where the decision is stated). The rejection reason is the one status with content, because a rejected Agent Note's verdict is the fact readers come for.

### The body skeleton

Every Agent Note opens its body with `## Problem` — the motivation, written to stand without the solution. What follows depends on the lifecycle; recurring sections use these canonical names and nothing else, while genuinely bespoke technical sections (package topology, wire contracts, schemas) remain free-form between the required ones.

#### `proposed/`

```markdown
## Problem
## Proposal
…bespoke sections…
## Alternatives considered
## Acceptance criteria
## Risks
```

`## Proposal` is the intended change and may legitimately speak in the future tense — plans, migration steps, and open questions belong here while the work is unbuilt. `## Acceptance criteria` says what observable state means done. `## Risks` covers both what could go wrong and what the change knowingly gives up.

#### `implemented/`

```markdown
## Problem
## Decision
…bespoke sections…
## Alternatives considered
## Consequences
```

`## Decision` describes shipped reality in the present tense. `## Consequences` records what the trade-off cost **and** bought. Proposal-era headings are spec-speak here and the reader should reject them: `## Proposal`, `## Plan`, `## Migration plan`, and `## Acceptance criteria` may not appear in an implemented Agent Note (they belong to `proposed/` only). A `## Testing`, `## Deferred`, or `## Related` section is fine where it states present-tense fact.

#### `rejected/`

A rejected Agent Note is the proposal, frozen: it keeps whatever proposal-time sections it had (including `## Acceptance criteria` or `## Plan`), and the verdict lives on the `Status:` line. Only the header block, the `## Problem` opener, a `## Proposal` section, and the Alternatives-considered mandate below apply.

### Alternatives considered — mandatory

Every Agent Note carries an `## Alternatives considered` section: each genuine alternative and why it lost, one bold-led paragraph per alternative or a `### Why not <X>?` subsection per contested one. A decision recorded without what it beat invites re-litigation — the failure Agent Notes exist to prevent.

Alternatives are recorded, never invented. An Agent Note dated before 2026-07-05 whose alternatives are not reconstructible from the record carries this exact comment in place of the section, which the gate accepts for pre-format files only:

```markdown
<!-- agent-note-format: alternatives-not-recorded (pre-format Agent Note) -->
```

### Moving between lifecycles

Moving a file between lifecycle folders means updating the `Status:` line and re-satisfying that folder's skeleton in the same change — reviewers fail the move otherwise. Concretely, `proposed/` → `implemented/` rewrites `## Proposal` into a present-tense `## Decision`, folds `## Acceptance criteria` and `## Risks` into `## Consequences` (or a present-tense `## Testing`/`## Verification` section for what now pins the behavior), and drops plans in favor of what shipped. `proposed/` → `rejected/` only adds the reason to the `Status:` line and freezes the file.

### Chinese counterparts

Every active Agent Note is a pair. The Chinese member `<note>.zh.md` is the body of record — authored first and kept authoritative — and the English member `<note>.md` carries the base name so the note is discoverable at its obvious path. This mirrors `README.md` / `README.zh.md` in this directory.

Both members carry the same header tokens and the same canonical section names, in English verbatim; only the title and the body prose are translated. Translating section names would break the sidecar's cross-member comparison. The format gate checks the English member, and the Chinese member is checked for structural agreement with it.

Every pair carries a **sidecar** consistency record at `<note>.i18n.yaml` — a small machine-checkable file attesting that the two members agree. A sidecar is created whenever a pair is created and re-recorded whenever either member changes, so a pair with no sidecar is treated as out of sync.

[`README.i18n.tokens.md`](README.i18n.tokens.md) defines the sidecar's contents, the two bilingual tokens, and the manual review checks that stand in for the pairing gate.
